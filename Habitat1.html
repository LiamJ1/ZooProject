    <h2> Jaguar</h2>
<p> <q> A symbol of the enigmatic power of the Amazon, the jaguar is the largest cat in the Americas. Jaguars have unusually large, round heads, short legs and a stunning coat dotted with dark rosettes and spots.

    They often live near water and are good swimmers. A jaguar’s ultra-strong jaws and teeth can bite through a crocodile skull or turtle shell, but they’ll prey on almost any wild animal they come across – including deer, armadillos, monkeys and lizards.

    Jaguars are not endangered at present. However, with its forest home increasingly being destroyed, and conflict growing with farmers and ranchers, the remaining jaguar population is under serious pressure. Jaguars now occupy less than half of their historical range. They’re so elusive that we don’t know exactly how many are left in the wild – but we do know their numbers are dropping. Help us protect these enigmatic cats.</q><br>
